This repository contains **partial core implementations** of the paper:

> **CSD: Constrained Speculative Decoding for Efficient On-device Structured Generation**

## Overview

This project demonstrates the **core algorithmic ideas** behind **Constrained Speculative Decoding (CSD)**, a decoding framework designed to improve the efficiency of **on-device structured generation** under strict constraints.

Due to **commercial and intellectual property considerations**, this repository **does not include the full production system**. Instead, it provides **selected core components** that are sufficient to illustrate the **key technical contributions** of the paper.

The released code is intended for:
- Understanding the main algorithmic design of CSD
- Academic reference and reproducibility discussion
- Research-oriented inspection of constrained speculative decoding

It is **not** intended to be a drop-in production implementation.
